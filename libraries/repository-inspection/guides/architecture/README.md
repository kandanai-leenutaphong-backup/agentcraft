# Architecture placement

Advisory ownership and dependency analysis, with a bundled standard-library checker.
The skill returns a placement packet; it does not implement the proposed change or authorize it.

## Use and verification

Install `repository-inspection` as described in the [library README](../../README.md).
Python 3.11+ is required. From the library directory:

```bash
python tests/architecture/selftest.py
repository-architecture --root /path/to/project
```

The checker reads the target's `architecture.json` and Python/JavaScript/TypeScript imports.
It reports overlapping ownership, undeclared edges, cycles and private-surface imports. Missing
or empty boundaries are advisory. Unresolved imports and unowned sources are reported, not proven.
It performs no writes to the target repository and requires no notebook, sibling skill or agent.

`python tests/architecture/fitness.py --root /path/to/project` preserves the optional
source-only legacy harness audit. It requires an actual legacy installation and is not
the installed library's acceptance gate.

## Dependency and provenance

Historical origin: workflow and legacy fitness source came from
`core/skills/dep/architecture-placement`; the checker came from `core/tools/arch.py`.
The current owner is [repository_inspection.architecture](../../src/repository_inspection/architecture.py).
The [migration manifest](../../MIGRATION.json) records the exact transfer and original hashes.
Parent integration must replace the duplicate `.github/tools/arch.py` engine with this API;
the library does not import that tool.

Selftests create temporary repositories and verify a permitted graph and matching negative
cases. They do not establish architectural correctness of a consuming project. No runtime state,
MCP server or installation hook is introduced.

## Removal

Removing thin discovery does not uninstall the library. Uninstall `repository-inspection`
only when its callers no longer need it. Target repositories, manifests and notebook records
remain unchanged.
