# Repository Inspection

One distribution, three distinct modules. Python 3.11+, standard library only.
No generic execution engine, network service, implicit repository root, or cleanup operation.

```bash
python -m pip install ./libraries/repository-inspection
```

Run from the repository root with the caller's chosen environment. Distribution
`repository-inspection`; public imports:

```python
from repository_inspection import architecture, catalogue, filesystem
```

| Module | Public Operations | State And Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `architecture` | `check(root)`, `hotspots(root, limit=15)`, `ArchError`, `main(argv)` | Reads one explicit repository and its `architecture.json`; no manifest is advisory, not verified correctness. |
| `catalogue` | `capability_catalogue(package, source_root=None)`, `report(...)`, `search(entries, query, limit=5)`, `main(argv)` | Reads validated catalogue metadata and contained Markdown documents; never imports or executes selected entries. |
| `filesystem` | `scan(root, group_depth=4, exclude=())`, `compare(before, after)`, `write_report(report, output=None)`, `main(argv)` | Reads metadata without following child symlinks. An explicit report output must be new and outside the scanned root. Never deletes inputs. |

## CLI

```bash
repository-architecture --root /path/to/project --json
repository-catalogue --root /path/to/catalogue-package --find "dead code" --json
repository-catalogue --root /path/to/catalogue-package --show protocol-garbage-collect --json
repository-inventory scan /path/to/project --output /tmp/new-inventory.json
repository-inventory compare /tmp/before.json /tmp/after.json
```

The equivalent module entrypoints are `python -m repository_inspection.architecture`,
`python -m repository_inspection.catalogue`, and `python -m repository_inspection.filesystem`.
Architecture and catalogue require `--root`; inventory requires its positional root.
No root is discovered relative to this installation or supplied through hidden environment state.

The catalogue reader retains the validated v1 package format: `skills/catalogue.json`,
`protocols/catalogue.json`, registered Markdown paths, and optional integrity/MCP metadata.
It installs no catalogue and downloads no missing entries. A missing, stale, oversized,
escaping or inconsistent document refuses. An explicit `--source-root` is required for
reviewed source-only entries. Parent integration will generate the canonical discovery
projection; this package does not author a second registry.

## Example And Checks

After installation, run from this library directory:

```bash
python examples/inspect_repository.py
python tests/architecture/selftest.py
python tests/filesystem/selftest.py
python tests/catalogue/selftest.py
```

The example calls all three public modules with temporary synthetic inputs, including
a forbidden dependency and net file additions. Tests retain graph ownership/cycle/public
surface refusals, missing-import reporting, catalogue aliases/staleness/traversal/symlink
guards, partial-scan refusal, logical hard-link counts, and non-overwriting external reports.

Architecture uses bounded static import resolution, not Python execution or whole-program
proof. Filesystem inventory is streaming but not an atomic snapshot or a scan-time quota;
quiesce writers and supply a bounded target. Logical bytes are not allocated disk or RAM savings.
Hosts own authorization, concurrent writers, and every destructive decision.

## Guidance And Integration

- [Architecture placement](guides/architecture/GUIDE.md), [limitations](guides/architecture/GOTCHAS.md).
- [Filesystem cleanup procedure](guides/filesystem/GUIDE.md), [inventory limits](guides/filesystem/GOTCHAS.md).
- [Catalogue discovery](guides/catalogue/GUIDE.md), [catalogue contract](guides/catalogue/CONTRACT.md).
- [Exact source migration paths and original hashes](MIGRATION.json).
- Original licenses: [architecture](guides/architecture/LICENSE), [filesystem](guides/filesystem/LICENSE), [catalogue](guides/catalogue/LICENSE).

Parent must enroll the distribution, regenerate discovery metadata, and replace the
duplicate `.github/tools/arch.py` implementation with a public-API launcher. Those paths
are outside this migration's write authority. No tool or catalogue registration was changed.

The retained [legacy fitness audit](tests/architecture/fitness.py) is source-only historical
coverage for projects with the old roster and copied-notebook installation. It is not
installed, not modern package acceptance, and not evidence that the current host is integrated.
