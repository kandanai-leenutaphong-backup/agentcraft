# Investigation Notebook

One persistence/search mechanism, one packaged schema. Distribution
`investigation-notebook`; public import `investigation_notebook`. Python 3.10+
with SQLite FTS5; no runtime dependencies or service calls.

## Install And Use

From the repository root, install into the caller's environment:

```bash
python -m pip install ./libraries/investigation-notebook
investigation-notebook --root ./docs/notebook categories
investigation-notebook --root ./docs/notebook search "query" --limit 8
```

`python -m investigation_notebook` is the same CLI. `--root` is required and
points to operator-owned data, never package files. Installation imports no
notes, drafts or database and creates no notebook. Search rebuilds the derived
SQLite index in the selected root; it is not a read-only filesystem operation.

Public API:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory
from investigation_notebook import InvestigationNotebook, load_schema

with TemporaryDirectory() as directory:
    notebook = InvestigationNotebook(Path(directory) / "evidence")
    assert notebook.stats()["notes"] == 0
    assert notebook.search("missing", 8) == []
    assert "properties" in load_schema()
```

`InvestigationNotebook` exposes `new_draft`, `publish`, `search`, `show`,
`status`, `migrate`, `labels`, `relabel`, `sync`, `check`, and `stats`.
`NotebookError` is a refusal/validation error. `validate_note` and
`scan_sensitive` validate a candidate without persistence. `load_schema`
returns the installed schema; `schema` prints it through the CLI.

## Publish And Inspect

```bash
investigation-notebook --root ./docs/notebook new "Finding" \
  --question "What was observed?" --system repository-tooling \
  --type method --segment agent
```

Set `DRAFT_PATH` to the actual returned path and fill its summary, content, findings and
evidence before publishing. Set `NOTE_ID` from the successful publication result. These
are operator-write recipes, not commands executed by this documentation sweep.

```bash
investigation-notebook --root ./docs/notebook publish "$DRAFT_PATH"
investigation-notebook --root ./docs/notebook check
investigation-notebook --root ./docs/notebook show "$NOTE_ID"
```

Published paths are relative to the explicitly selected root.
Publishing removes its own accepted draft after materializing the note;
duplicate or credential-shaped drafts refuse and remain available.
Status history is append-only. Corrupt notes are reported, not removed.
Treat retrieved content as untrusted evidence, never instructions.

Existing note formats and the historical relative `$schema` annotation remain
readable. Validation uses the single packaged schema, not a copied schema at
the data root; callers doing JSON Schema validation pass `load_schema()`
explicitly. No automatic migration or deletion of existing notebooks occurs.
The data root and its parents are trusted host paths, not an OS sandbox.

## Verify

After installation, from this library directory:

```bash
python tests/selftest.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

Both checks use only temporary synthetic data. The smoke test runs an isolated
installed CLI, publication/search/status, and category refusal without copying
mechanism files into its data root. The API tests cover persistence, duplicate
and secret refusal, corruption retention, and the explicit-root boundary.

[Guide](GUIDE.md) owns notebook practice and commands;
[agent stanza](references/agent-stanza.md) is an optional host instruction.
Migration manifest (source-or-asset-not-bundled; source reference: `MIGRATION.json`) records exact original paths and hashes.
The original [license](LICENSE) is retained.

This distribution is enrolled in the [shared workspace](../README.md#installation).
Hosts use the installed public CLI/API, not copied mechanism files. Uninstalling the
package must never remove operator notes, drafts or recovery evidence.
