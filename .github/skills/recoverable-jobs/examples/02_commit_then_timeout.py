"""Worked example 2 — the write timed out. Did it land? Look before answering.

Run it: ``python3 examples/02_commit_then_timeout.py``.

A store write that times out client-side **may already have succeeded**. Those
are two different worlds and the caller has to be told which one it is in:

- it landed  → the run is done; re-running it would duplicate real work;
- it did not → the run is not done; the output is still on disk, locally.

The difference is one cheap read of the id the caller minted. Reporting
"nothing was saved" without that read is how twenty minutes of finished work
gets done twice — or worse, how a completed run is silently lost.
