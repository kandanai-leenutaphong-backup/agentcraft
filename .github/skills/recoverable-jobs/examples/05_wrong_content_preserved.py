"""Worked example 5 — wrong content, corrupt files, and foreign artifacts.

Run it: ``python3 examples/05_wrong_content_preserved.py``.

Three ways a naive implementation destroys the thing it was protecting:

1. Treating "something exists under that id" as "our run landed". It is
   somebody else's document, and reporting success loses this run's output.
2. Accepting a truncated artifact, or deleting it because it "looks broken".
3. Tidying up a directory by removing files it did not recognise.

All three are refusals here, and in every one of them the bytes stay on disk.
