"""Worked example 3 — known-missing, refused, unreachable, and unknown.

Run it: ``python3 examples/03_absent_unknown.py``.

Four store failures, four different things to tell an operator. Collapsing
them into one "save failed" is what makes recovery guesswork:

- **refused** — the store said no. Nothing landed. Do not look for it.
- **unreachable** — never sent. Retried, bounded, then reported absent.
- **accepted but not readable back** — unknown. It may be catching up. Do not
  claim it is saved, and do not claim it is lost either.
- **the check itself failed** — unknown, with the id, so a person can look.
