"""Worked example 4 — a fresh process finds the work and commits it again.

Run it: ``python3 examples/04_restart_and_recommit.py``.

This is the recovery half, and it is deliberately unglamorous: the output is
already complete, so nothing is re-run and nothing is resumed. A new process
opens the directory, reads what is there, and offers it to the store again.

It also shows the two things that must *not* happen while recovering: an
unrelated run's artifact is not touched, and a second process claiming the same
run id is refused rather than allowed to overwrite the first one's only copy.
