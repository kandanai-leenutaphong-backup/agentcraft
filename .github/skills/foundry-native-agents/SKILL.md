# Foundry Native Agents

Build agentic apps on native Microsoft Foundry capability first. Every claim below links a
testbed receipt, record or operator document; `unverified` marks the rest. Guidance only:
loading this skill authorizes no cloud call.

[H runtime lock](../../../testbeds/foundry-hosted-agents/deploy/runtime-requirements.lock),
[O host lock](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent%20optimization/deploy/host-requirements.lock)
(adds the loader), [O dependency manifest](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent%20optimization/deploy/dependency-manifest.json).
`httpx==0.28.1`; uv 0.9.30. Other versions are untested here, not forbidden.

## Decision Rule: Native First

Use the native feature when it covers the requirement. Write custom code only for a named,
concrete requirement the native surface does not meet, keep it minimal, and record why.

| Situation | Choice | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Score an optimizer's candidates | Register a custom code evaluator natively | Native optimizer consumes only registered evaluators |
| Report accuracy/macro-F1 of candidates | Independent hosted validation, local frozen scorer | Native composite `avg_score` is not that metric (O) |
| Frozen cohorts, immutable generations, lineage | Local [agent-optimization](../agent-optimization/SKILL.md) library | Native candidate IDs carry no generation/parent lineage (O) |
| Dataset upload with per-stage recovery | Native `pending_upload`/Blob/`create_or_update` stages, not `upload_file` | Provenance capture and recovery per stage (E) |
| Config acquisition | Public `load_config` at runtime; one bounded GET retained | Loader 1.0.0b1 strips whitespace, allows fallback, has no timeout (O) |
| Model loop | MAF via `llm_interface`; no second runner | One owner of the tool loop (H) |
| Hosting fallback | None; no ACA fallback for a Hosted Agent | Out of scope in H; use [deploy-container-apps](../deploy-container-apps/SKILL.md) only for a separate web app |

Counter-example: raw candidate-list REST was removed in O once
`get_optimization_job().result.candidates` matched it; custom authenticated HTTP sites went 6 → 1
([acceptance gaps](../../../deploy/remediation-evidence/20260922T193935Z-acceptance-gaps/README.md)).

## Lifecycle

`write` = cloud mutation or billable inference; each needs explicit, scoped authorization
recorded before the action. Never replay a settled write; reconcile unknown outcomes read-only.

| # | Stage | Native operations | Cloud write |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Preflight | Offline tests; read account, project, model, registry, role, evaluator | no |
| 2 | Build | Allowlisted archive → `az acr build`; image smoke of real SDK readiness | **write** (billable) |
| 2a | Registry pull | Exact registry-scoped `AcrPull` for project identity, only when absent | **write** (RBAC) |
| 3 | Deploy version | `agents.create_version`; wait ≤300 s for active exact image/metadata | **write** |
| 4 | Verify | `get_version` readback; one authenticated invoke; stored-response readback; anonymous 401 | **write** (invoke = inference, stored response, session) |
| 5 | Evaluate | Dataset reserve/upload/register; `evals.create`; `runs.create`; reconcile reads | **write** + judge inference |
| 6 | Optimize | Evaluator register + 1/0/0 canaries; optimizer model deployment if absent; one job | **write** (billable) |
| 7 | Promote / restore | New version loading the returned config; baseline version retained as restore target | **write** |
| 8 | Teardown | Frozen inventory manifest, then delete in order below, then readback | **write** (destructive, separate authority) |

Promotion needs its own authority and labels: a regressing candidate may be hosted only as a
labelled demonstration, never as best configuration
([O demonstration result](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent%20optimization/deploy/evidence/demonstration-result.json)).
Teardown order: stored responses → hosted sessions → agent versions (T finding; T itself ran
sessions first and had to repeat them). Remaining order as executed in T: optimization jobs,
eval runs, evals, agent versions, agent, evaluator versions, dataset versions, model deployment,
ACR manifests ([T ledger](../../../deploy/remediation-evidence/20260923-cleanup/teardown/20260923T092540658731Z-ledger.jsonl)).
`unverified`: whether any other order among those later kinds fails.

## Traps

| # | Trap | Rule | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Responses retrieve/delete through `get_openai_client(agent_name=...)` re-creates deleted hosted sessions with the same IDs | Delete responses before sessions, sessions before versions | [T `findings`](../../../deploy/remediation-evidence/20260923-cleanup/teardown/20260923T101500000000Z-teardown-report.json) |
| 2 | `openai` 3.13 maps that endpoint's 404 to `APIConnectionError` | Read back deletion with raw `httpx` GET `{base_url}responses/{id}` → 404 | [T `deleted_notes`](../../../deploy/remediation-evidence/20260923-cleanup/teardown/20260923T101500000000Z-teardown-report.json), [manifest code](../../../deploy/remediation-evidence/20260923-cleanup/teardown_manifest.py) |
| 3 | `evals.runs.delete` is eventually consistent; `evals.delete` returns `deleted=false` (async) | Repeat bounded readback passes; 404 is the proof | [T `deleted_notes`](../../../deploy/remediation-evidence/20260923-cleanup/teardown/20260923T101500000000Z-teardown-report.json) |
| 4 | Agent delete (`force=False`) 409 while sessions exist; deleting the last version removes the agent | Delete versions; read agent 404 | [T `deleted_notes`](../../../deploy/remediation-evidence/20260923-cleanup/teardown/20260923T101500000000Z-teardown-report.json) |
| 5 | Session list returns deleted and re-created records with the same ID | Judge by state, not ID presence | [T `findings`](../../../deploy/remediation-evidence/20260923-cleanup/teardown/20260923T101500000000Z-teardown-report.json) |
| 6 | Dataset registration rejects versions >50 chars; `pending_upload` accepted 71 | Short version (`sha256-<32 hex>`); full hash stays the content pin | [E version evidence](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent-evaluation/deploy/records/version-recovery-evidence.json) |
| 7 | Eval `sample.output[].content` holds a JSON-encoded list of `output_text` blocks | Decode, extract text, cross-check `datasource_item["sample.output_text"]`; judge `results[].sample` is not target output | [E README "Result shape"](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent-evaluation/deploy/README.md), [E verify](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent-evaluation/deploy/records/20260922T075653771799Z-verify.json) |
| 8 | Hosted inference failed `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` (version 1) | Pass `ssl.create_default_context()` through public `connect(..., transport=...)`; keep `CERT_REQUIRED` + hostname check; no bypass | [H logs](../../../testbeds/foundry-hosted-agents/deploy/records/20260922T055753697020Z-logs.json), [spec](../../../specs/20260922_FOUNDRY_HOSTED_AGENTS_EXPERIMENT.md) |
| 9 | Native optimizer candidate IDs (`_0001`, list order, `max_candidates`) are not generations or lineage | Store service IDs and observation order; generation/parent stay null | [O README "Generation Semantics"](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent%20optimization/deploy/README.md), [spec](../../../specs/20260922_FOUNDRY_AGENT_OPTIMIZATION.md) |
| 10 | Native composite `avg_score` is not an independent metric (not macro-F1) | Measure candidates with an independent scorer under separate names | [O native](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent%20optimization/deploy/evidence/native-mapping-v2-recomputed-metrics.json) vs [independent](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent%20optimization/deploy/evidence/candidate-validation-metrics.json) |
| 11 | Access control proven only by success is unproven | Anonymous invoke must return 401/403; 404, login page or 200 fail | [H verify `anonymous_status: 401`](../../../testbeds/foundry-hosted-agents/deploy/records/20260922T060202403083Z-verify.json) |
| 12 | Native optimizer supplies output in `item["sample.output_text"]`, not `item["response"]`; first job scored 0 | Canary positive/wrong/invalid = 1/0/0 on the native field before any job | [O mapped canary](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent%20optimization/deploy/evidence/migration-o-v1/20260922T180900595917Z-mapped-canary.json), [O README](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent%20optimization/deploy/README.md) |
| 13 | SDK advertises `evaluation_level="turn"`; service returns HTTP 400 | Omit it | [O README](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent%20optimization/deploy/README.md) |
| 14 | Optimizer `Operation-Location` returns an internal path that 404s publicly | Poll with `get_optimization_job(job_id)`; never resubmit | [O README](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent%20optimization/deploy/README.md) |
| 15 | `max_candidates` caps generated candidates (baseline excluded) and promises none; baseline-only jobs occur | Accept actual returned count; baseline-only refuses collection | [O README](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent%20optimization/deploy/README.md) |
| 16 | Snake-case `dataset_items` is not wire JSON (`items` is); registration omits metric `threshold` | Build rows with typed SDK constructors; check 1/0/0 independently of pass threshold | [O README](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent%20optimization/deploy/README.md) |
| 17 | Foundry-managed dataset storage lives in a provider subscription; SAS exists only in process memory | Capture non-secret metadata before validation; require account/host/container containment; never retain SAS | [E README "Managed Storage Rule"](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent-evaluation/deploy/README.md) |
| 18 | `az acr build --no-wait` serialized stdout as `null` on this host | Accept exactly one `Queued a build with ID:` diagnostic; ambiguity refuses resubmission | [H README](../../../testbeds/foundry-hosted-agents/deploy/README.md) |
| 19 | `deployments` raw `as_dict()` wire keys differ from typed properties | Use typed `model_name`/`model_version` | [E README "Public APIs"](../../../testbeds/foundry-agent-evaluation/deploy/README.md) |
| 20 | Host SDK disables in-flight crash recovery; synchronous tool side effects are not undone on cancel | Claim completed-response retrieval only; keep tools side-effect-free | [H README](../../../testbeds/foundry-hosted-agents/deploy/README.md) |
| 21 | `builtin.tool_call_accuracy` errors every row ("Tool definitions input is required") for tools inside the hosted container: `sample.tool_definitions` is empty | Use `builtin.tool_call_success` (`response: {{sample.output_items}}`, 12/15 passed); keep accuracy out of gates | [P eval summary](../../../agentcraft_projects/foundry-agent-package-e2e-20260924/records/live/pkg-e2e-baseline-v1/eval-src-d51b5dad684649d0f0202d79-pkg-95667431e925f468-v1-df3c66519eb40d8d-summary.json) (15/15 errored) |
| 22 | SDK `model_dump` of a response adds null-only fields (`async_`, `caller`, `namespace`, `phase`) the raw GET omits | Compare stored responses with null-only fields dropped | [P verify blocked](../../../agentcraft_projects/foundry-agent-package-e2e-20260924/records/live/pkg-e2e-baseline-v1/20260924T073740278955Z-verify.json), [rerun complete](../../../agentcraft_projects/foundry-agent-package-e2e-20260924/records/live/pkg-e2e-baseline-v1/20260924T073954810889Z-verify.json) |
| 23 | Eval `sample.output[]` assistant messages carry `function_call`/`tool_call` blocks beside text | Target-text extraction skips those blocks (encoded offline in `foundry_ops.evaluation.target_text`) | [P eval summary](../../../agentcraft_projects/foundry-agent-package-e2e-20260924/records/live/pkg-e2e-baseline-v1/eval-src-d51b5dad684649d0f0202d79-pkg-95667431e925f468-v1-df3c66519eb40d8d-summary.json), [local recompute](../../../agentcraft_projects/foundry-agent-package-e2e-20260924/records/live/pkg-e2e-baseline-v1/baseline-validation-local-recompute.json) |

| 25 | Project system identity holds no `AcrPull` on a registry it was never granted (read-only probe: absent) | Prerequisite, not a deploy.sh step: `preflight` reports the gap; owner grants registry-scoped `AcrPull` before `deploy` | [P G1 intent](../../../agentcraft_projects/foundry-agent-package-e2e-20260924/records/prereqs/g1-acrpull-intent.json), [P prereqs](../../../agentcraft_projects/foundry-agent-package-e2e-20260924/records/prereqs/20260924T065314900608Z-prereqs.json) |

## Lifecycle Glue Owner

[`libraries/foundry-ops`](../../../libraries/foundry-ops/README.md) (import `foundry_ops`) is the
shared lifecycle glue owner. Reuse it for receipts, pinned manifests, build, deploy, readback,
probes and ordered teardown; do not re-implement those steps per app. Its API is owned there.
Start new apps from [`template_apps/foundry_hosted_agent`](../../../template_apps/foundry_hosted_agent/README.md)
and run them with [protocol-foundry-agent-lifecycle](../../protocols/protocol-foundry-agent-lifecycle/SKILL.md).
