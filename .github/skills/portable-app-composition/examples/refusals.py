"""Worked example: what this skill refuses, and the message you get back.

Run it:

    python3 examples/refusals.py

Every refusal below is asserted on its ``field`` or its type, not on prose, so
this file is also the compatibility test for those messages. If you are here
because something was rejected, find the shape that matches yours and read the
comment above it.

The last two sections are the ones people are surprised by: an asset shipped by
two members is refused until the document names an owner, and authorisation is
never the composition's job.
