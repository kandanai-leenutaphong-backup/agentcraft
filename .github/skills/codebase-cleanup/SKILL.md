name: codebase-cleanup
description: 'Use when a workspace has excessive files, stale artifacts, duplicate restore trees, unused research mirrors, or editor indexing and memory pressure, and the user asks for aggressive codebase cleanup. Measure first, prove candidates unused, protect data and user changes, capture recoverable evidence, delete only an authorized frozen manifest, validate the app, and prevent regrowth. Not permission to delete canonical data, security controls, backups, dependencies in use, or cloud resources.'

# Codebase Cleanup

Read [the canonical guide](../harness-guide/repository-inspection/guides/filesystem/GUIDE.md).
Install `repository-inspection`; use `repository_inspection.filesystem` or
`repository-inventory scan <root>`. Inventory and comparison never delete inputs.
Deletion decisions require host authorization and a frozen manifest; preserve data and user changes.
