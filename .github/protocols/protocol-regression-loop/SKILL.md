# Protocol: regression loop

The loop is implement → gate → deploy → confirm identity → sweep → observe, repeated until the named
acceptance command passes. Its value is not the steps but that the acceptance command is written
down before the work starts, so "done" cannot move mid-work.

An explicitly requested documentation sweep uses [protocol-document](../protocol-document/SKILL.md).
An individual prose edit needs only its affected claims checked. Where done means a
person verifying it, this loop is the mechanical half of
[protocol-demonstrate](../protocol-demonstrate/SKILL.md), not a substitute for its blind walk.

## When it earns its cost

A change proven against something real: a test suite, a build, a deployed service, a data pipeline.
Especially where the artefact under test is rebuilt or redeployed — that is where confident false
passes come from.

Skip it for a change already covered by one command you were going to run anyway. Announcing a loop
to run one test is ceremony.

## Steps

1. **Fix the acceptance command in writing.** Runnable verbatim by someone else, pass condition
   stated. Not runnable as written is the first defect — fix it before touching anything else.
   Every step below depends on it.
2. **Implement**, then run the cheapest check covering the changed slice: a compile, the owning
   test, the focused selftest. Cheap and specific beats broad and slow; a broad suite hides which
   change broke it.
3. **Rebuild or redeploy only if the change is not exercised in place.** An edit to a running
   interpreter's source needs no deploy; a container image does.
4. **Confirm artefact identity before probing.** Revision, digest, build id, process start time, or
   output timestamp. This separates a real pass from a cached one; skipping it is how a green sweep
   gets reported against the previous build.
5. **Sweep acceptance.** Each case reports its own status and error count. Run cases separately
   where a bulk run would hide which case failed and how far it got.
6. **Observe.** Table of case, result, errors, plus artefact identity and wall-clock time. Timing is
   evidence: a suite that passed impossibly fast did not run.

## The failure loop

Any failure stops the sweep. Diagnose before fixing — produce the reproducer and root cause, then
change code. Re-verify from step 2, not from the failing case.

**Three iterations.** Still red after the third is a structural blocker, not an unlucky run: say so,
name what is in the way, ask for direction rather than starting a fourth. The fourth iteration of an
unchanged approach is where hours go.

## Gates

- Keep failures attributable. A sweep whose output cannot say which case failed is not evidence.
- Never anchor a result on an intermediate event when a terminal event carries it: a request
  accepted is not a job finished; a rollout started is not a revision serving.
- A backgrounded call is not a finished call. Use the runtime's completion notification or result
   mechanism; do not infer completion from an acknowledgement or busy-poll a notified process.
- Immutable inputs stay immutable. Never edit a generated artefact whose generator owns it — change
  the generator and regenerate, or the next run silently reverts the fix.
- Never weaken, skip, or special-case a check to make the sweep green. A disabled assertion is a
  defect with a green light on it.
- On real infrastructure, create and update freely within what is authorized; confirm before
  deleting, tearing down, force-pushing, or changing shared network posture.
- Secrets stay out of the transcript, the arguments, and the notes. Probe results are reported by
  status and count, never by response body.

## Acceptance

One line carrying the artefact it was measured against:
`regression PASS — <artefact identity>, N/N cases, 0 errors`.

A partial is reported as a partial. "Passing except for" is a fail with extra words.

## Records

- The procedure, if refined: `type: method`.
- A reachable failure mode and its reproducer: `type: bug`, fixed or not.
- The run's acceptance contract, artefact identity and outcome: its `work-issue` note. Not the run
  log.
